# The Golden Square Challenges

These exercises & challenges involved the following:

* Test-driving programs with multiple classes.
* Breaking programs up into classes.
* Debugging programs.
* Building software through pair-programming.
* Understanding why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and
  pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.

### How to navigate:

_Each phase folder contains projects & challenges which require different skills_

1. **Phase-1** - Learned to write tests with RSpec.
2. **Phase-2** - Learned strong test-driving, object-oriented design, and debugging practices.
3. **Phase-3** - Learned to isolate tests using RSpec.

Note:
The _'mocking_bites'_ directory is a challenge that is supposed to be part of phase-3.
